This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\r\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\r\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\r\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\r\n *\r\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\r\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\r\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\r\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\r\n * persistence.\r\n *\r\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\r\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\r\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\r\n *\r\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\r\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\r\n * operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\r\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\r\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\r\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\n/**\r\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the primary client object store.\r\n */\nfunction Xi(t) {\n  return $r(t, Vr.store);\n}\n\n/**\r\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the client metadata object store.\r\n */\nfunction $i(t) {\n  return $r(t, Jr.store);\n}\n\n/**\r\n * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\r\n * LocalStorage.\r\n */\nfunction Zi(t, e) {\n  // Use two different prefix formats:\n  //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\n  //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\n  // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\n  // so there's no danger of collisions.\n  var n = t.projectId;\n  return t.m || (n += \".\" + t.database), \"firestore/\" + e + \"/\" + n + \"/\"\n  /**\r\n  * @license\r\n  * Copyright 2020 Google LLC\r\n  *\r\n  * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n  * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n  * You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n  *\r\n  *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n  *\r\n  * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n  * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n  * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n  * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n  * limitations under the License.\r\n  */;\n}\n\nvar to = function (t, e) {\n    this.progress = t, this.zo = e;\n  },\n  eo = /** @class */function () {\n    function t(t, e, n) {\n      this.wo = t, this.Ho = e, this.Ti = n\n      /**\r\n      * Get the local view of the document identified by `key`.\r\n      *\r\n      * @returns Local view of the document or null if we don't have any cached\r\n      * state for it.\r\n      */;\n    }\n\n    return t.prototype.Jo = function (t, e) {\n      var n = this;\n      return this.Ho.vi(t, e).next(function (r) {\n        return n.Yo(t, e, r);\n      });\n    }, /** Internal version of `getDocument` that allows reusing batches. */t.prototype.Yo = function (t, e, n) {\n      return this.wo.fi(t, e).next(function (t) {\n        for (var r = 0, i = n; r < i.length; r++) {\n          t = i[r].xs(e, t);\n        }\n        return t;\n      });\n    },\n    // Returns the view of the given `docs` as they would appear after applying\n    // all mutations in the given `batches`.\n    t.prototype.Xo = function (t, e, n) {\n      var r = vn();\n      return e.forEach(function (t, e) {\n        for (var i = 0, o = n; i < o.length; i++) {\n          e = o[i].xs(t, e);\n        }\n        r = r.Ht(t, e);\n      }), r;\n    },\n    /**\r\n     * Gets the local view of the documents identified by `keys`.\r\n     *\r\n     * If we don't have cached state for a document in `keys`, a NoDocument will\r\n     * be stored for that key in the resulting set.\r\n     */\n    t.prototype.Zo = function (t, e) {\n      var n = this;\n      return this.wo.getEntries(t, e).next(function (e) {\n        return n.tc(t, e);\n      });\n    },\n    /**\r\n     * Similar to `getDocuments`, but creates the local view from the given\r\n     * `baseDocs` without retrieving documents from the local store.\r\n     */\n    t.prototype.tc = function (t, e) {\n      var n = this;\n      return this.Ho.Si(t, e).next(function (r) {\n        var i = n.Xo(t, e, r),\n          o = dn();\n        return i.forEach(function (t, e) {\n          // TODO(http://b/32275378): Don't conflate missing / deleted.\n          e || (e = new Ut(t, Z.min())), o = o.Ht(t, e);\n        }), o;\n      });\n    },\n    /**\r\n     * Performs a query against the local view of all documents.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param transaction - The persistence transaction.\r\n     * @param query - The query to match documents against.\r\n     * @param sinceReadTime - If not set to SnapshotVersion.min(), return only\r\n     *     documents that have been read since this snapshot version (exclusive).\r\n     */\n    t.prototype.Wr = function (t, e, n) {\n      /**\r\n      * Returns whether the query matches a single document by path (rather than a\r\n      * collection).\r\n      */\n      return function (t) {\n        return it.Et(t.path) && null === t.collectionGroup && 0 === t.filters.length;\n      }(e) ?

Data is stored persistently\r\n * across sessions.\r\n *\r\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\r\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\r\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\r\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\r\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\r\n *\r\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\r\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\r\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\r\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\r\n * persistence.\r\n *\r\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\r\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\r\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\r\n *\r\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\r\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\r\n * operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\r\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\r\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\r\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\r\n/**\r\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the primary client object store.\r\n */\r\nfunction Xi(t) {\r\n    return $r(t, Vr.store);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the client metadata object store.\r\n */ function $i(t) {\r\n    return $r(t, Jr.store);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\r\n * LocalStorage.\r\n */ function Zi(t, e) {\r\n    // Use two different prefix formats:\r\n    //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\r\n    //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\r\n    // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\r\n    // so there's no danger of collisions.\r\n    var n = t.projectId;\r\n    return t.m || (n += \".\" + t.database), \"firestore/\" + e + \"/\" + n + \"/\"\r\n    /**\r\n * @license\r\n * Copyright 2020 Google LLC\r\n *\r\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n *\r\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n *\r\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n * limitations under the License.\r\n */;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar to = function(t, e) {\r\n    this.progress = t, this.zo = e;\r\n}, eo = /** @class */ function() {\r\n    function t(t, e, n) {\r\n        this.wo = t, this.Ho = e, this.Ti = n\r\n        /**\r\n     * Get the local view of the document identified by `key`.\r\n     *\r\n     * @returns Local view of the document or null if we don't have any cached\r\n     * state for it.\r\n     */;\r\n    }\r\n    return t.prototype.Jo = function(t, e) {\r\n        var n = this;\r\n        return this.Ho.vi(t, e).next((function(r) {\r\n            return n.Yo(t, e, r);\r\n        }));\r\n    }, \r\n    /** Internal version of `getDocument` that allows reusing batches. */ t.prototype.Yo = function(t, e, n) {\r\n        return this.wo.fi(t, e).next((function(t) {\r\n            for (var r = 0, i = n; r < i.length; r++) {\r\n                t = i[r].xs(e, t);\r\n            }\r\n            return t;\r\n        }));\r\n    }, \r\n    // Returns the view of the given `docs` as they would appear after applying\r\n    // all mutations in the given `batches`.\r\n    t.prototype.Xo = function(t, e, n) {\r\n        var r = vn();\r\n        return e.forEach((function(t, e) {\r\n            for (var i = 0, o = n; i < o.length; i++) {\r\n                e = o[i].xs(t, e);\r\n            }\r\n            r = r.Ht(t, e);\r\n        })), r;\r\n    }, \r\n    /**\r\n     * Gets the local view of the documents identified by `keys`.\r\n     *\r\n     * If we don't have cached state for a document in `keys`, a NoDocument will\r\n     * be stored for that key in the resulting set.\r\n     */\r\n    t.prototype.Zo = function(t, e) {\r\n        var n = this;\r\n        return this.wo.getEntries(t, e).next((function(e) {\r\n            return n.tc(t, e);\r\n        }));\r\n    }, \r\n    /**\r\n     * Similar to `getDocuments`, but creates the local view from the given\r\n     * `baseDocs` without retrieving documents from the local store.\r\n     */\r\n    t.prototype.tc = function(t, e) {\r\n        var n = this;\r\n        return this.Ho.Si(t, e).next((function(r) {\r\n            var i = n.Xo(t, e, r), o = dn();\r\n            return i.forEach((function(t, e) {\r\n                // TODO(http://b/32275378): Don't conflate missing / deleted.\r\n                e || (e = new Ut(t, Z.min())), o = o.Ht(t, e);\r\n            })), o;\r\n        }));\r\n    }, \r\n    /**\r\n     * Performs a query against the local view of all documents.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param transaction - The persistence transaction.\r\n     * @param query - The query to match documents against.\r\n     * @param sinceReadTime - If not set to SnapshotVersion.min(), return only\r\n     *     documents that have been read since this snapshot version (exclusive).\r\n     */\r\n    t.prototype.Wr = function(t, e, n) {\r\n        /**\r\n * Returns whether the query matches a single document by path (rather than a\r\n * collection).\r\n */\r\n        return function(t) {\r\n            return it.Et(t.path) && null === t.collectionGroup && 0 === t.filters.length;\r\n        }(e) ?
